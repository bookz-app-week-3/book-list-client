## Overview
<!--  -->
Created the framework for structuring the html and js files that manage the front end of our project.
## Getting Started
<!--   -->
First we worked on building up the server files and making a template to auto generate the books.json to our DB. Next we created a system where we would produce results to the html page. In our book.js we created a variable to store our heroku link, then task to handle incoming tasks and throw an error if something went wrong.
## Architecture
<!--  -->
Languages: SQL, HTML, JS, Git.
Libraries: JQuery, Normalize
